# Starting a repository to increase employability prospects...

Instead of signing up for ATS providers,
or paying for resumee scanners

## Making my own personal ATS checker seemed more suitable...

It could work better, but at least you can upload resumees in pdf and it will show you the parsed text.
If you've ever wondered why application forms screw your cv attached so badly, this could give a hint of how well the ATS retrieves your info.
It will show you the parsed text it could extract from your attached file, along with locations, job titles, degrees, and experience time, so you can check if there is any formatting or inconsistency mistake.
